# Carbon-Prediction-Modelling

Notebooks of our research and modelling for Carbon Emission Prediction. for the dataset in this model, we create it ourselves in such a way that the data is trained and after that we use the model.

| Information     | Value                                                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model Input     | can be a city name or coordinates as a starting point.                  |
| Model Output    | Value of predicted carbon emissions generated based on travel distance  |

This model is being implemented on out system.
